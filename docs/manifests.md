## Manifests

A "manifest" describes a resource that is external to flows. These can refer to databases, Swagger docs, JSON schemas, cloud services, or third-party connectors. By configuring manifests, JumpWire can automate the collection or publishing of data to and from data sources, and in many cases, catalog the structure of data directly from the schemas of data sources.
