## Manifests

A Manifest describes a resource that is external from JumpWire. Examples include databases, Swagger docs, JSON schemas, cloud services, or third-party connectors.

By configuring Manifests, JumpWire can automate the collection or publishing of data to and from data sources, and in many cases, catalog the structure of data directly from the schemas of data sources.
