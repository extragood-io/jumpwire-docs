## Welcome to JumpWire

JumpWire is an integration platform that connects internal data to external/vendor APIs. It can be used to create connections between various systems for the purpose of transferring data between them. JumpWire calls these connections "flows", and they represent a series of steps for extracting, transforming and loading data between systems. Examples of systems to connect include SaaS or vendor APIs, internal databases or data warehouses, streaming data including change data capture, or data from internal tools or services.

JumpWire provides benefits out-of-the-box for these types of workloads. All ETL steps are resilient to failure and pre-configured for reties and backoffs. This is useful for scenarios where an API or system may be unavailable for a brief period but then recovers. JumpWire also simplifies ETL programming by abstracting common protocols such as HTTPS and DBMS, in some cases eliminating the need for any custom coding beyond field matching.

By using JumpWire, teams gain increased visibility into the characteristics of connected systems such as data types being exchanged as well as rate, volume and availability. This is helpful for monitoring integration health wrt SLAs, and auditing governance of data handling hygene.
